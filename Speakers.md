**Professor Kweon** received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in Mechanical Design and Production Engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 1981 and 1983, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Robotics from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990. He worked for Toshiba R&D Center, Japan, and joined KAIST in 1992. He is a professor of electrical engineering (EE) and the head of the Future Vehicle Division at KAIST. 
Professor Kweon's research interests include computer vision and robotics. He served the IJCV as an Editorial Board Member for 2005~2015.
Professor Kweon is a member of many computer vision and robotics conference program committees and has been a program co-chair for several conferences and workshops. Most recently, he is now serving as Program Chairs for ICCV'2019. Professor Kweon received several awards from the international conferences, including "The Best Student Paper Runnerup Award" from in the CVPR in 2009 and “The Best  Paper Award" from the IEEE T. of CSVT in 2014.
